Variable Scope. Scope in JavaScript refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of variables to JavaScript.
Difference between Let and Var 
var is function scoped and let is block scoped
The let variables have temporal dead zones while the var variables donâ€™t. 
variable with var can be redeclared to some other value while variable could not be redeclared if it is defined with let.
let variables are usually used when there is limited use of those variables such as in for loops, while loops or inside the scope of if conditions etc while var variable is used when value of variable need to be less change and used to accessed globally.
