Difference between null and undefined
null is a special value meaning "no value". null is a special object because typeof null returns 'object'. On the other hand, undefined means that the variable has not been declared, or has not been given a value.
undefined represents the value of a variable that wasn't yet initialized, while null represents an intentional absence of an object.
